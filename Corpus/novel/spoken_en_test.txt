When my husband was going into the dining room this morning, he dropped some coins on the floor.

Last week, my four-year-old daughter, Sally, was invited to a children's party.
Sally was very excited because she had never travelled on a train before.
She sat near the window and asked questions about everything she saw.
Suddenly, a middle-age lady got on the train and sat opposite Sally.
The lady was dressed in a blue coat and a large, funny hat.
After the train had left the station, the lady opened her handbag and took to her power compact.
I live in a very old town which is surrounded by beautiful woods.
On Sundays, hundreds of people come from the city to see our town and to walk through the woods.
Visitors have been asked to keep the woods clean and tidy.
Litter baskets have been placed under the trees, but people still throw their rubbish everywhere.
The little baskets were empty and the ground was covered with pieces of paper, cigarette ends, old tyres, empty bottles and rusty tins.
When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously.
However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.
The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw'a large cat' only five yards away from her and it immediately ran away when she saw it.
Experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.
The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.
Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits.
Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.
Several people complained of "cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree.
The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from?
As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape.
The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught.
It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.
Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired.
The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.
One night, however, our vicar work up with a start: the clock was striking the hours!
Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one o'clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.
Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on.
In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.
'Whatever are you doing up here Bill?'asked the vicar in surprise.
'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now.You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'
'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well.Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'
'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one o'clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it."
"Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing.Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'
Some time ago, and interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea.
An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promontory of Ayia Irini.
The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization.
The city was equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.
The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from the fifteenth century B.C.until Roman times.
In the most sacred room of temple, clay fragments of fifteen statues were found.
Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been painted.
The body of one statue was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C,and it's missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C.
This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved.
When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess turned out to be a very modern-looking woman.
She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her hips.
Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed,but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.
These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices.
People who work in offices are frequently referred to as "white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.
Such is human nature, that a great many people are often willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers.
This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.
When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job.
Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit and then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.
Before returning home at night,he took a shower and changed back into his suit.
Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.
Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job and will soon be working in an office.
He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money.
From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him'Mr.Bloggs', not'Alf'.
Editors of newspapers and magazines often go to extremes to provide their reader with unimportant facts and statistics.
Last year a journalist had been instructed by a well-known magazine to write an article on the president's palace in a new African republic.
When the article arrived, the editor read the first sentence and then refuse to publish it.
The article began: 'Hundreds of steps lead to the high wall which surrounds the president's palace'.
The editor at once sent the journalist a fax instructing him find out the exact number of steps and the height of the wall.
The journalist immediately set out to obtain these important facts, but the took a long time to send them Meanwhile, the editor was getting impatient, for the magazine would soon go to press.
He sent the journalist two more faxes, but received no reply.
He sent yet another fax informing the journalist that if he did not reply soon he would be fired.
When the journalist again failed to reply, the editor reluctantly published the article as it had originally been written.
A week later, the editor at last received a fax from the journalist.
Not only had the poor man been arrested, but he had been sent to prison as well.
However, he had at last been allowed to send a fax in which he informed the editor that the he had been arrested while counting the 1,084 steps leading to the fifteen-foot wall which surrounded the president's palace.
The expensive shops in a famous near Piccadilly were just "opening.
At this time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty.
Mr.Taylor, the owner of a jewellery shop was admiring a new display.
Two of his assistants had been working busily since eight o'clock and had only just finished.
Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet.
After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr.Taylor went back into his shop.
The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its home blaring, roared down the arcade and it came to a stop outside the jeweller's.
One man stayed at the wheel while two others with black stocking over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars.
He and his staff began throwing furniture out of the window.
One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain.
The raid was all over in three minutes, for the men scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed.
Just as it was leaving, Mr.Taylor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases.
They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.
Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket?
When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white?
People who live in Britain needn't despair when they made mistakes like this!
Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or to their dog.
A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiancé, John, runs a successful furniture business.
John had very good day and put his wallet containing $3,000 into the microwave oven for safekeeping.
When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her fiancé's wallet as well.
Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash!
John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: the Mutilate Ladies!
'So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back,' said a spokeswoman for the Bank.
The Great St.Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy ,at 2,473 metres, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe.
The famous monastery of St.Bernard, witch was founded in eleventh century, lies about a mile away.
For hundreds of years, St.Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travellers crossing the dangerous Pass.
These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia, were used as watchdogs even in Roman times.
Now that a tunnel ahs been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveller is in difficulty.
Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.
During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars.
As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure.
The temperature drops to -30 degree and very few people attempt to cross the Pass.
The monks prefer winter to summer of they have more privacy.
The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure.
The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter.
These young people, who love the peace of mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St.Bernard's monastery.
They can be friendly and affectionate towards humans, but they lead mysterious lives of their own as well.
One of the things that fascinates us most about cats is the popular belief that they have nine lives.
Apparently, there is a good deal of truth in this idea.
Recently the New York Animal Medical Center made a study of 132 cats over a period of five months.
All these cats had one experience in common: they had fallen off high buildings, yet only eight of them died from shock or injuries.
Of course, New York is the ideal place for such an interesting study, because there is no shortage of tall buildings.
One cat, Sabrina, fell 32 storeys, yet only suffered from a broken tooth.
It seems that the further cats fall, the less they are likely to injure themselves.
In a long drop, they reach speeds of 60 miles an hour and more.
This increases their air-resistance and reduces the shock of impact when they hit the ground.
